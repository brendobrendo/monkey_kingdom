# 🐵 Monkey Decision-Making Model

## **1️⃣ Core Motivations: Survival & Reproduction**
At the most fundamental level, a monkey's **decisions are driven by its need to survive and reproduce**. Every action it takes is based on an **internal model** that estimates which behaviors will **maximize** its likelihood of passing down its genes.

## **2️⃣ Monkey’s Internal State**
Each monkey maintains an **internal physical state** that influences its capabilities and decision-making:

### **Physical State Variables**
- **Strength/Weight** – Determines combat effectiveness and dominance.
- **Restedness** – Affects energy levels and ability to engage in long-term activities.
- **Nourishment** – Hunger level, influencing food-seeking behaviors.
- **Hydration Level** – Water needs, driving the search for nearby water sources.
- **Internal Temperature** – Regulates behavior in extreme heat or cold conditions.

## **3️⃣ Belief Systems & Perception**
Monkeys form beliefs that shape their understanding of themselves, their group, and the external world.

### **Beliefs About the Self**
- **Self-Reliance** – Perceived ability to act independently without relying on the group.

### **Beliefs About the Group**
- **Strength Hierarchy** – Identifies the strongest individuals.
- **Social Status** – Determines who is the most well-liked.
- **Trustworthiness** – Identifies allies and potential betrayers.

### **Beliefs About Its Role in the Group**
- **Social Rank** – Estimates its own position in the dominance hierarchy.
- **Personal Likeability** – Determines how others perceive it within the group.

### **Beliefs About the External World**
- **Safety Assessment** – Evaluates threats from other groups.
- **Resource Availability** – Determines if there are sufficient food and water sources.
- **Environmental Dangers** – Identifies predators or hazardous terrain.
- **Geographical Awareness** – Recognizes paths to critical resources like food and water.

## **4️⃣ Core Behavioral Drivers**
A monkey's decisions are guided by its beliefs and its fundamental needs, which can be categorized into six core **behavioral values**:

| **Behavioral Value**   | **Description** |
|------------------------|----------------|
| **Certainty**          | Ensuring safety and avoiding pain. |
| **Variety**            | Seeking new experiences and change. |
| **Significance**       | Gaining importance, status, or uniqueness. |
| **Connection**         | Building close bonds with other monkeys. |
| **Growth**             | Expanding understanding and capabilities. |
| **Contribution**       | Supporting and helping others in the group. |

Each action the monkey takes is based on an **expected value calculation** of how well it fulfills these needs while increasing **survival and reproductive success**.

## **5️⃣ Available Actions**
Monkeys can take various actions based on their beliefs, status, and immediate needs:

### **Social & Hierarchical Actions**
- 🥊 **Fight** – Challenge another monkey to increase rank or defend resources.
- 🏳 **Submit** – Avoid conflict by showing deference.
- 🤝 **Request Allyship** – Attempt to form an alliance.
- ✅ **Accept Allyship** – Strengthen social bonds with a trusted monkey.
- ❌ **Betray** – Backstab an ally for personal gain.
- 🔁 **Remember Betrayal** – Store memory of past betrayals.

### **Survival Actions**
- 💧 **Get Water** – Seek hydration from the nearest source.
- 🍌 **Eat** – Consume food to restore nourishment.
- 🍽 **Share Food** – Offer food to build trust and gain allies.

### **Nurturing & Social Grooming**
- 🍼 **Nurture** – Take care of offspring or close allies.
- 🧼 **Groom** – Strengthen bonds by grooming another monkey.

## **📌 Summary**
- Monkeys make **decisions** based on their **physical state, beliefs, and core needs**.
- **Survival & reproduction** drive all actions.
- Their beliefs about **self, group, and environment** shape their strategy.
- They can take **various actions** like fighting, submitting, forming alliances, and resource gathering.
