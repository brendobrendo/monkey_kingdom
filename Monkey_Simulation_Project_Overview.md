# Monkey Social Simulation Game

## Overview
This project is a **high-level simulation game** that models how **monkeys develop social capital, gain access to resources, and navigate intra- and inter-tribal dynamics**. Instead of direct interactivity, the game provides **a structured dashboard with exportable data** for analysis and storytelling.

## Core Features

### 1. **AI & Behavior Modeling**
- **Agent-Based Simulation**: Monkeys act based on **social rank, resource availability, and environmental factors**.
- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**: Handles basic actions (foraging, resting, moving).
- **Behavior Trees/Decision Trees**: Governs **complex social interactions** (alliances, betrayals, dominance struggles).
- **Simulation Logic**: Focused on **lightweight CPU performance**, avoiding GPU-intensive operations.

### 2. **Game UI & Visualization**
The game features a **dashboard-based interface**, focusing on high-level data visualization rather than real-time rendering of individual agents. The primary visual component is a **Risk-style 2D map**, which serves as the central way to track **territory control, population distribution, and key game events**.

#### **Map Design & Representation**
The map is divided into **major territories**, each containing **distinct sub-territories** labeled for reference (e.g., *Western Plains*, *Tallgrass Valley*). **Only one tribe can occupy a territory at a time**, with the controlling tribe‚Äôs **color** visually marking ownership (e.g., üî¥ Firefangs, üîµ Shadow Claws). Each territory displays a **numeric token** representing the **number of monkeys present**, similar to army stacks in *Risk*, dynamically updating as populations **migrate, battle, or reproduce**.

#### **Territory Visualization**
- **Color-Coded Control System**:
  - üü¢ **Green** ‚Äì Resource-rich region.  
  - üü° **Yellow** ‚Äì Balanced conditions.  
  - üî¥ **Red** ‚Äì Conflict zone.  
  - ‚ö´ **Grey** ‚Äì Unoccupied territory.  
- **Overlay Icons for Key States**:
  - ‚öîÔ∏è **Active Conflict** ‚Äì A battle is ongoing in this region.  
  - üçå **Resource Abundance** ‚Äì High food and water availability.  
  - ‚è≥ **Pending Migration** ‚Äì A significant population shift is about to occur.  

#### **Movement & Combat Mechanics**
- Monkeys **move into adjacent unoccupied territories** or **engage in combat** when entering enemy-occupied regions.  
- **Combat determines new ownership**‚Äîthe winner claims the territory, and the losing tribe is either displaced or eliminated.  
- **Movement constraints** exist based on **natural barriers** (e.g., rivers, mountains, dense forests), influencing strategic decisions.  

This **simplified, data-driven board** enables players to **quickly interpret tribal dominance, population shifts, and strategic positioning** while remaining **lightweight and AI-driven**, ensuring smooth **simulation exports for storytelling purposes**.

### 3. **Data-Driven Gameplay (Copy-Paste Export for Storytelling)**
- **Game State Summary** (Snapshot of entire simulation).
- **Territory Breakdown Panel** (Stats on population, dominance, resources, and recent events).
- **Monkey Profiles** (Details on specific individuals, including rank, allies, needs, and actions).
- **Recent Events Log** (Chronological list of significant occurrences in the game world).

#### **Example Exported Data Format**
```yaml
Simulation Snapshot:
- Time: Day 34
- Total Monkeys: 120
- Dominant Tribe: Firefangs (35 members)
- Highest Conflict: Western Plains (Territory 4)
- Major Event: Alpha of the Firefangs, "Grizzle," challenged rival leader "Torn Ear" and won. The Firefangs expanded their territory.
```

### 4. **Development Considerations**
- **Tech Stack**:
  - **Web-Based UI**: React + D3.js for visualization.
  - **Backend Simulation**: Python (Flask).
  - **Data Storage**:
    - **MongoDB**: Stores **game state, territory details, and event logs** in a flexible, document-based format.
    - **Neo4j**: Manages **monkey relationships, social dynamics, and power structures**, enabling efficient graph-based queries.
    - **PostgreSQL**: Introduced later for **structured economic/resource systems**, ensuring transactional consistency as the game expands.
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - No complex animations or rendering of individual agents.
  - Dashboard updates periodically based on simulation state.
- **Expandability**:
  - Future auto-generated **weekly summary reports**.

## Why This Approach?
‚úÖ **Lightweight & CPU-Friendly** (No GPU required).  
‚úÖ **Structured for Exporting Data to ChatGPT** (For AI-generated storytelling).  
‚úÖ **Minimalist UI Focused on Simulation & Metrics**.  
‚úÖ **Scalable & Modular for Future Enhancements**.

### **Next Steps**
1. Develop **initial simulation logic** (FSMs, behavior trees, resource mechanics).  
2. Implement **basic UI with a working map and dashboard**.  
3. Design **export functionality for ChatGPT integration**.  
4. Playtest and refine monkey behaviors for emergent interactions.
